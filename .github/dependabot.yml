# Dependabot: keep go.mod (root and tools/) and Dockerfile up to date.
# PRs trigger on refs/heads/dependabot/** in build/drone.jsonnet.
# To auto-merge when CI passes: enable "Allow auto-merge" in repo Settings →
# Pull Requests, and use .github/workflows/dependabot-automerge.yml (or enable
# auto-merge manually on each Dependabot PR).
